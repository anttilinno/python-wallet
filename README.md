# Welcome back to Python
Theoretically this should give overview of my Python journey.

## What will I be building
> User has a **wallet**, which cointains **coins**. Coins have properties *id, symbol, name and amount*. Calculate the value of the portfolio.

## Versions
| Version | Description| Subjective evaluation |
|----------|-----------|-----------------------|
| 0.0 | Skipped. I did not build wallet as a list | -
| 1.0 | Simple python (`main.py` and `wallet.yaml`). Wallet is defined as yaml file. | Horrible
| 2.0 | Basic OOP. Wallet is still yaml. Simple classes Coin and Wallet. Return total wallet price. | Still horrible
| 3.0 | Introduce better structure. Write unit tests.
| 4.0 | ...

### Loose ideas
* Create CLI using [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/)
* Create API with [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
* Create possibility to create wallet from zero. Add coins through CLI, which creates/adds to wallet
* Create frontend with Graphs, which fetches trends from backend
* Create cron script, which stores historical data
* Deploy app to Kubenetes
* Manage app with CI/CD
* **Create a list, what real project needs** (architecture document, best practices etc.)
* Host it in Oracle Cloud
